# ///////////////////////////////
The project consists of 3 main files

--> Merging Files
--> ML model
--> predictions.py (in data_presentation folder) 

Merging Files is the first part of the project, then after that ML model file will help to compute
results and in the last pedictions.py will help to present the data in a web page, for running 
predictions.py file simply write this command on your terminal/commandLine
"python predictions.py" and then wait a bit so that the file will load all the libraries 
and then it will show you the link in the terminal/command Line to access the webpage.
